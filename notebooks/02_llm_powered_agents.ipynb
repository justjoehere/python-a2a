    "\n",
    "1. Create LLM-powered A2A agents using OpenAI and Anthropic models\n",
    "2. Customize agent behavior using system prompts\n",
    "3. Implement function calling capabilities\n",
    "4. Handle multi-turn conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python A2A package makes it easy to create powerful, interoperable agents that can leverage the capabilities of different LLM providers. By standardizing the message format and providing a consistent interface, A2A enables seamless communication between agents regardless of the underlying model or implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interoperability is key to building modular AI systems where specialized agents can collaborate to solve complex problems. Whether you're using OpenAI's GPT models, Anthropic's Claude, or other LLMs, the A2A protocol provides a common language for agent communication."
